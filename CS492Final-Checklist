1. Use of Encryption for Sensitive Data
   Concepts to Incorporate:

Symmetric key encryption (AES with CBC mode).
Public-key cryptography (RSA) for secure key exchange.
Implementation:

Encrypt sensitive data (e.g., user account details, balance, transaction history) before storing it in text files.
Use AES-CBC for encrypting transaction details, where the initialization vector (IV) is stored securely or regenerated deterministically.
Use RSA to securely share the AES key between the program and the user (or a server in future extensions). 2. Advanced Authentication Mechanisms
Concepts to Incorporate:

Multi-factor authentication (2FA).
Secure password hashing with salting (use bcrypt or Argon2 instead of plain SHA-256).
Implementation:

Add an optional 2FA layer using an OTP (One-Time Password) generator.
Salt each password before hashing to defend against rainbow table attacks. Update your hashPassword method to include salt.
Include account lockout after several failed login attempts. 3. Secure Protocols for Communication
Concepts to Incorporate:

Secure communication protocols like TLS for encrypting data transmitted between a client (user) and a server.
Implementation:

Simulate a client-server interaction where the ATM communicates with a mock bank server over a secure protocol (use Java's SSL libraries).
Store transaction data securely on the server instead of locally. 4. File Integrity and Malware Resistance
Concepts to Incorporate:

Cryptographic hash functions for file integrity.
Anti-reverse engineering techniques.
Implementation:

Compute and store hash values (e.g., SHA-256) of text files (e.g., balanceSheet.txt, accountInfo.txt) to verify their integrity during program execution.
Add basic obfuscation or encryption of code sections to resist reverse engineering. 5. Intrusion Detection and Logs Analysis
Concepts to Incorporate:

Logging and intrusion detection for unauthorized access attempts.
Implementation:

Maintain a log file of all login attempts (successful or failed) with timestamps and IP addresses (mock IPs for now).
Analyze logs for suspicious behavior (e.g., multiple failed login attempts within a short period) and trigger alerts. 6. GUI and Secure User Interaction
Concepts to Incorporate:

Secure GUI design.
Protection against input injection attacks.
Implementation:

Create a Java Swing-based or JavaFX GUI for user interaction.
Validate all inputs rigorously to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL or shell injections).
Integrate secure input fields for passwords (masked input with protection against clipboard capturing). 7. Ethics and Justifications
Concepts to Incorporate:

Professional ethics as outlined in the ACM Code of Ethics.
Implementation:

Include a justification for each design decision, focusing on how it improves security and aligns with ethical principles (e.g., user data protection, fair access).
Discuss potential ethical challenges, such as the trade-off between usability and security. 8. Software Reverse Engineering Defense
Concepts to Incorporate:

Anti-debugging and anti-reverse engineering techniques.
Implementation:

Add checks to detect debugging attempts (e.g., using the ManagementFactory class to detect debuggers).
Use Java obfuscators to make your compiled .class files harder to decompile. 9. Authorization and Role-Based Access
Concepts to Incorporate:

Role-based access control (RBAC).
Access control lists (ACLs).
Implementation:

Add user roles (e.g., admin, teller, customer) with different permissions.
Securely define and enforce access levels for different functionalities (e.g., only admins can view logs). 10. Network Security and Firewall Simulation
Concepts to Incorporate:

Firewalls and basic network intrusion detection.
Implementation:

Simulate a firewall by monitoring and restricting access to specific IPs or ports.
Add a mock network scanner that alerts when unauthorized IPs try to access the system.
Integration of Concepts into Existing Code
To implement these, you can start with:

Refactoring the storage layer to use encryption.
Enhancing the AccountDriver for 2FA and better authentication workflows.
Adding a GUI for ease of use and incorporating secure data transmission protocols.
Potential Challenges and Justifications
Challenge: Balancing user experience with stringent security.
Justification: Security mechanisms like 2FA are necessary to protect sensitive banking operations.
Challenge: Performance overhead due to encryption.
Justification: Essential for confidentiality and integrity in financial transactions.
This approach ensures your project meets the "non-trivial application" requirement while demonstrating mastery of multiple security concepts.
